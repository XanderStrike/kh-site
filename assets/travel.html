<h1>Not a Portlander?</h1>
<h2>Hotels</h2>
<p>We haven't booked a group rate anywhere -- prices we were quoted weren't competitive with what we could find online.</p>

Most of the nice hotels are in downtown Portland, on the west side.  You might look at 
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.bensonhotel.com">Benson Hotel</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.markspencer.com">Mark Spencer</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/oregon/hilton-portland-and-executive-tower-PDXPHHH/index.html">Hilton</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/iiTF2G">Look around</a> for others.  The <a href="http://www.jupiterhotel.com/">Jupiter</a> is close to the venue, with a "young, hip vibe" -- there's a bar and music venue downstairs.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>You can rent a private room or a whole house on <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnB</a> or <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/">VRBO</a>.  We'll be staying a few nights in a small AirBnB in Northwest Portland.</p>

<h2>Getting around</h2>
<p>Public transit in Portland is called <a href="http://trimet.org/">TriMet</a>.  It serves the airport (PDX) and has stops near the venue and all the hotels listed above.

<p>If you're planning a longer stay, or want to see the famous outdoors of the Pacific Northwest, plan to rent a car at the airport or <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=portland%20downtown%20car%20rental">downtown</a></p>
