<p><em>Our wedding day will include both ancient rituals and modern re-interpretations...</em></p>

            <h3>Why Sunday?</h3>
            <p>Under Jewish law, weddings are forbidden during the Sabbath.  Jews observe <em>shabbat</em> from sunset Friday
            to sunset Saturday.  Since the summer days are long, Sunday is the only weekend option.</p>

            <h3><em>Chuppah</em></h3>
            <p>The wedding canopy is intended to create a sacred space symbolizing the home that the bride and groom will share
            together. The sides are left open to signify that friends and family are welcome in their new life and home.</p>

            <p>The fabric that will cover our <em>chuppah</em> has been in Gabe's family for several generations.</p>

            <h3>Seven Blessings</h3>
            <p>The <em>Sheva Brachot</em> express gratitude for the beauty of the moment and the splendor of life.</p>

            <p>The blessings are adapted from ancient rabbinic teachings, beginning with the blessing over the wine and ending with
            a communal expression of joy.</p>

            <p>We will be using <a href="/blessings">modern English translations.</a></p>

            <h3>Contracts</h3>

            <p> Before the ceremony starts, we will sign two contracts: a civil one from the State of Oregon and a Jewish one. </p>

            <p> Traditionally, a Jewish marriage was formalized in a document called a <em>ketubah</em>.  The Aramaic text is 2000 years old
            and was progressive for its time.  But it treats the bride as property "acquired" by the groom.</p>

            <p>Over the last half-century, Jews have modified and re-interpreted that text to fit our evolving standards of ethics,
            adding language about equality, love and mutual responsibility.  But the roots of the <em>ketubah</em> remain in ancient property law.</p>

            <p>We have chosen to sign something different.  Called a <em>B’rit Ahuvim</em> or "Lovers’ Covenant", it is based on the Jewish law
            of bilateral partnerships, where two equals enter into an agreement for their mutual benefit.
            The <em>B’rit Ahuvim</em> outlines our obligations to one another and our family.</p>

            <p>You can read the <a href="brit-ahuvim.pdf">contract that we will sign here</a>,
            and learn more about its feminist origins in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807036196"><em>Engendering Judaism</em> by Rachel Adler</a>.  </p>

            <h3>Breaking the Glass</h3>

            <p>At the end of the ceremony, Gabe will step on a glass wrapped in cloth.
            This is a nonreligious but very old custom, with many interpretations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A reminder of the destruction of the first Temple in Jerusalem</li>
                <li>A statement that the world is in exile, broken, and requiring our care</li>
                <li>An excuse "for levity to break out"</li>
                <li>A way to sober up a raucous party</li>
                <li>An ancient method for frightening and appeasing demons, who were believed to be attracted to the fortunate</li>
                <li>A reminder of the fragility of relationships, which must be treated with care, love and respect</li>
                <li>A sexual metaphor</li>
                <li>A signal that the ceremony is over</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>Yichud</em></h3>
            <p>Immediately after the ceremony, we will retreat from the <em>chuppah</em> to a private room for a few moments of <em>yichud</em>, seclusion.</p>

            <p>In ancient times, this was when the marriage would be consummated, but for the last several centuries, the tradition has lived on as a 
            symbolic consummation, a statement of the couple's dedication to each other and their right to privacy. </p>

            <p>It is also a chance for us to exhale, gather our thoughts, and share a bite to eat.</p>
