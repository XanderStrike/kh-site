        <h2>How it started</h2>
        <p>Our lives first intersected in a hotel lobby near Chicago’s O’Hare Airport in April 2003.
        Alana, a high-school junior, was applying for the <a href="http://byfi.org/">BYFI</a> summer program in Israel.
        Gabe, a college freshman and alumnus of the summer program, was helping out for the day -- greeting applicants while they waited for their interviews.
        We parted ways with a mutual crush.</p>

        <p>Alana attended the program and started college in Chicago a year later.
           After that, our lives crossed paths periodically, most often at BYFI alumni events,
           sometimes in the home of Larry Edwards, a faculty member and (then) Rabbi at
           <a href="http://www.orchadash.org/faq.html">Congregation Or Chadash in Chicago</a>.</p>

        <p>
        We’re grateful to have Rabbi Edwards officiate our wedding.
        </p>
